# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

This file defines project-agnostic working rules for Codex/AI agents operating inside a repository.

Project-specific product requirements, architecture decisions, data contracts, deployment procedures, framework conventions, and domain rules should live in separate project documents. Do not add project-specific assumptions to this file unless they are truly intended to apply to every project using it.

---

## 1. Session Start and Context Loading

At the start of a new session, do not read the entire repository by default.

1. Inspect the current repository state with non-destructive commands such as:
   - `git status --short --branch`
   - recent `git log`
2. Read this `AGENTS.md`.
3. Read project guidance documents only if they exist, for example:
   - `PROJECT_STATUS.md`
   - `ROADMAP.md`
   - `README.md`
   - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
   - `docs/PRODUCT_SPEC.md`
   - `docs/OPERATIONS.md`
   - relevant runbooks or work logs
4. Classify the user's request and identify the smallest relevant area of the repository.
5. Read only:
   - the owning entry point
   - direct dependencies
   - related configuration
   - related tests
   - directly relevant documentation
6. Do not scan or load the whole repository unless the task genuinely requires it.
7. Treat Markdown documentation as a map, specification, or decision record. Confirm implementation facts in actual code, configuration, workflows, migrations, and tests before editing.
8. Preserve existing user changes and unrelated in-progress work. Do not revert, overwrite, clean up, or reformat unrelated changes.

Do not assume a document, script, command, package, path, branch, or workflow exists until it has been verified.

---

## 2. Change Consent

Do not modify repository files unless the user clearly asks for implementation.

Requests such as the following are analysis-only by default:

- investigate
- review
- explain
- diagnose
- evaluate
- compare
- inspect
- research
- plan
- suggest
- propose
- "why is this happening?"
- "is this okay?"
- "what should we do?"
- "look into this"
- "check this"

For analysis-only requests:

- read files as needed
- run safe, non-destructive inspection or verification commands
- explain findings
- propose a change set if useful
- do not apply file changes

Only modify code, configuration, documentation, tests, scripts, workflows, or repository files when the user clearly asks to:

- implement
- edit
- change
- apply
- add
- remove
- create
- fix

If intent is ambiguous, ask before making changes.

An implementation request approves only the requested scope. It does not automatically approve:

- unrelated refactoring
- feature expansion
- deployment
- external writes
- infrastructure changes
- broad cleanup
- dependency upgrades unrelated to the request
- destructive operations

---

## 3. Scope Discipline

Keep changes tightly scoped to the user's request.

- Do not refactor unrelated code just because it can be improved.
- Do not rename, move, or reorganize unrelated files.
- Do not introduce infrastructure "for future use" unless the current requirement needs it.
- Prefer the simplest design that satisfies the current request.
- Preserve existing behavior outside the requested change.
- Preserve unrelated local modifications.
- Prefer small, reviewable patches over broad rewrites.
- If a required change expands beyond the original scope, explain why before proceeding.

When a task can be solved locally, do not automatically add:

- a database
- a server
- authentication
- a queue
- a worker
- a cache layer
- a SaaS dependency
- a paid API
- a new framework

---

## 4. Source of Truth

Use the most authoritative available source for each claim.

Typical priority:

1. Actual runtime code and configuration
2. Tests and executable verification
3. Migrations, workflows, schemas, and deployment configuration
4. Current project status or architecture documents
5. Historical notes and work logs
6. Memory or assumptions

Do not claim that something is implemented solely because a Markdown document says so.

When documentation and implementation disagree:

- treat implementation as the current runtime truth
- report the mismatch
- do not silently "correct" one side unless the user requested changes

---

## 5. High-Risk Change Approval

Before performing a hard-to-reverse, externally visible, costly, broad, or high-blast-radius action, stop and obtain explicit user approval.

This applies even when the agent has full filesystem, shell, Git, cloud, database, or network access.

Always require approval before actions such as:

### Production and External State

- production deployment
- publishing or changing a public site's live state
- changing DNS, routes, cache, runtime variables, hosting, or production infrastructure
- writing to an external database or production data store
- applying, reverting, repairing, or modifying remote database schema
- creating, updating, or deleting data in external services
- changing repository settings, permissions, branch protection, Actions settings, or similar external configuration

### Secrets and Credentials

- creating, changing, rotating, deleting, printing, or exposing:
  - API keys
  - tokens
  - passwords
  - OAuth credentials
  - `.env` secrets
  - credential-bearing URLs
  - cloud or database secrets

Never place secrets in source code, logs, documentation, screenshots, or chat output.

### Cost, Quota, and Traffic

- creating paid resources
- enabling services that may incur charges
- changing billing plans
- adding a paid API or SaaS service
- running bulk/backfill jobs
- greatly increasing scheduled request frequency
- running large external API jobs
- performing actions likely to consume substantial external quota or traffic

### Destructive File Operations

- recursive deletion
- broad cleanup of many files
- deleting untracked user files
- overwriting local source/import files that are not recoverable from Git
- commands such as:
  - `rm -rf`
  - `Remove-Item -Recurse`
  - `git clean`

### Destructive Git Operations

- `git reset --hard`
- `git push --force`
- history-rewriting rebase
- deleting remote branches or tags
- rewriting remote history
- other Git operations that can discard work or make recovery difficult

### System or Global Configuration

- changing PATH
- changing shell profiles
- changing PowerShell execution policy
- changing operating-system settings
- installing/removing global npm, Python, or system packages
- modifying global Git configuration
- modifying files outside the project/repository directory

### Broad Repository Changes

Ask first when a change:

- modifies, moves, renames, or deletes many files
- changes shared architecture across many domains
- changes a public API or core data contract broadly
- has a large blast radius
- has unclear rollback
- could invalidate significant user work

This list is not exhaustive. If the change is difficult to review or roll back, ask first.

---

## 6. Approval Request Format

When approval is required, explain:

- the exact command or action
- the files, repository, service, database, or infrastructure affected
- whether external state will change
- whether cost, quota, or traffic may be affected
- the main risk
- the rollback path
- if full rollback is not possible, say so explicitly

Do not proceed from implied approval. Wait for a clear confirmation of the specific action.

---

## 7. Normal Low-Risk Work

Once the user has explicitly requested implementation, the following normally do not require separate high-risk approval when they stay within scope:

- reading repository files
- ordinary code edits inside the repository
- adding or updating relevant tests
- linting
- formatting affected files
- type checking
- local builds
- local test execution
- `git status`
- `git diff`
- `git log`
- other non-destructive inspection commands

Normal implementation permission does not override the high-risk approval rules above.

---

## 8. External Access Safety

When accessing external APIs, websites, or services:

- prefer official APIs, SDKs, feeds, or documented interfaces when available
- access only data the project is authorized to access
- do not bypass authentication, CAPTCHA, anti-bot systems, rate limits, or access controls
- do not implement proxy rotation or blocking circumvention to defeat restrictions
- use limited retries with backoff
- avoid unnecessary request volume
- stop and report repeated `401`, `403`, `429`, quota, or clear blocking signals rather than bypassing them
- do not guess data that the source does not provide
- preserve source identifiers and original URLs when relevant
- distinguish unverified community/user-generated content from verified facts when that matters to the product

Do not add paid external services without user approval.

---

## 9. Implementation Rules

- Verify current project structure before editing.
- Use the project's existing patterns unless there is a strong reason not to.
- Do not assume framework or package versions from memory.
- Inspect the actual dependency manifest and lockfile before relying on version-specific APIs.
- Prefer existing dependencies over adding new ones when practical.
- Do not add unused dependencies.
- When adding a dependency, be able to explain why it is needed.
- Keep UI, domain logic, data access, and background jobs separated according to the project's existing architecture.
- Do not make page rendering trigger unrelated background or ingestion work unless that is explicitly part of the design.
- Keep repeated contracts and shared types centralized when appropriate.
- Do not log or expose secrets.
- Prefer targeted search tools such as `rg` over broad repository reads.
- Prefer small patches over rewriting whole files.
- Avoid silently changing formatting conventions across unrelated code.
- Do not fix unrelated warnings or bugs unless the user asks or they directly block the requested task.

---

## 10. Framework and Tool Version Awareness

Before writing version-sensitive code:

1. Inspect the actual installed version.
2. Read the version-relevant local documentation if the project provides it.
3. Prefer current project conventions over remembered framework conventions.
4. Respect deprecation warnings.
5. Do not copy old patterns from training knowledge when the installed version differs.
6. Do not upgrade major framework or dependency versions unless the user requested it or the change is required and approved.

If generated project-specific agent guidance exists inside dependencies or framework tooling, follow it when relevant, but do not blindly copy project-specific generated rules into this global file.

---

## 11. Verification Policy

After implementation, verify the smallest affected area first.

General order:

1. focused unit or component test
2. relevant linting
3. type checking
4. related integration or browser test
5. build
6. broader project verification only when justified by the change

Use the project's existing scripts. Do not invent scripts that do not exist.

Examples:

- logic change → related unit tests
- UI change → relevant UI test, lint, typecheck, and build as appropriate
- routing/metadata/browser-state change → relevant integration or browser verification
- workflow/config change → syntax and execution-condition validation
- database migration → isolated migration verification before any remote application
- documentation-only change → lightweight documentation checks such as `git diff --check`

For high-cost or slow verification suites, choose checks based on the current diff rather than running everything automatically.

If a test or verification step cannot be run:

- state what was not verified
- explain why
- state the likely impact or remaining uncertainty

Do not claim success for checks that were not executed.

---

## 12. Documentation Synchronization

Documentation should match the behavior being committed or pushed.

When implementation changes affect existing documentation, update the relevant documents if they exist.

Typical examples:

- current implementation/status → status document
- architecture or responsibility boundaries → architecture document
- user-visible behavior → product specification
- API/data contracts → integration or data model documentation
- deployment, scheduling, secrets, operations, verification, rollback → operations/runbook documentation
- setup/onboarding → README
- meaningful completed work or important decisions → work log

Do not create documentation solely to satisfy a template when the project does not need it.

Before pushing changes, verify that relevant documentation is not stale.

If an urgent push is explicitly requested while documentation is known to be stale, tell the user before pushing and identify the follow-up documentation work.

---

## 13. Git Workflow

- Inspect the diff before staging or committing.
- Stage only files related to the requested change.
- Do not include the user's unrelated modifications in a commit.
- Use concise commit messages that describe the intent of the change.
- Do not use destructive Git commands.
- Do not rewrite history unless explicitly approved under the high-risk rules.

Do not create commits, push, open pull requests, merge, tag, or release unless the user explicitly asks for that action.

When the user requests a push:

1. verify the intended branch and remote
2. verify the relevant checks
3. verify relevant documentation is current
4. review the staged/committed diff
5. then push only the requested changes

---

## 14. Cost and Simplicity

Prefer the least complex solution that satisfies the requirement.

Unless the user explicitly approves otherwise:

- prefer free solutions when they are sufficient
- prefer local or static processing when practical
- do not add paid APIs or paid SaaS
- do not create unnecessary cloud resources
- do not introduce a database solely for convenience
- do not add servers or background infrastructure without a current need
- do not design speculative infrastructure for hypothetical future scale

When a simpler or free approach no longer satisfies the requirement:

1. explain why
2. present alternatives
3. describe cost and complexity tradeoffs
4. let the user decide

---

## 15. Final Response

Keep the final response concise and useful.

For implementation work, summarize:

- what changed
- what verification was run
- what passed or failed
- whether any commit, push, deployment, database write, or other external state change occurred
- what could not be verified
- any remaining risk or clearly relevant next step

For analysis-only work:

- describe findings
- do not imply files were changed
- clearly separate confirmed facts from proposed changes

Do not repeat a long internal work log unless the user asks for it.
